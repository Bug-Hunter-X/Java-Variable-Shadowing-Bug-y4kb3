This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Java programming: variable shadowing.  The `MyClass.java` file contains code that exhibits this issue.  The `MyClassSolution.java` file provides a corrected version. Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (such as a method) has the same name as a variable declared in a larger scope (such as an instance variable). The inner variable then "shadows" the outer variable, making it inaccessible within the inner scope without explicitly referencing it using `this`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and debugging challenges.  This example highlights the importance of choosing distinct variable names and understanding variable scope in Java.
